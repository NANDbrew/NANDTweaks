# NANDTweaks
AKA NANDbrew's kitchen sink. AKA a bunch of stuff that doesn't really fit anywhere else

**Storage:**  *(App24 made this feature, I just polished it)*
- items can be put into crates if they match the original contents.
- food must be cooked/uncooked to match container
- crates can only hold their original quantity
- look text shows amount stored and capacity
- non-food items (fishing hooks, firewood, tobacco) can be put into their respective crates
- can be disabled for compatibility with Natorius's Item Storage
  
**CargoDecal**
- Adds a logo to mission goods so they're easier to identify
- color can be changed customized
- can be toggled
  
**Shipyard:**
- show weight of selected sail
- show weight of selected ship parts (masts, stays, roofs, etc.)
- fixed sailwind bug where certain stays were listed in the 'masts' pane, not the 'stays' pane
- Wide Shipyard UI (adjusts shipyard UI to better fit 16:9 displays) (toggleable)
  
**Save thumbnails**
- Save slot buttons now show a screenshot from the last time it was saved (toggleable)
- Thumbnail Compatibility mode (switch how save slot thumbnails are saved, in case they don't work right)
- toggle for loading/saving save slot thumbnails

**Other:**
- Elixirs now show their type when looked at (toggleable) (they also now make a sound when you drink them)
- Held maps can be rotated with right click  _(App24 made this feature, I just polished it)_
- Scrolls can be closed/opened with right click
- Alcohol now makes you stay asleep longer (by request, ripped from @rahakami 's QoL mod)
- Added interior triggers to indoor shops/offices (wind/rain now go quiet like they do in ships' cabins)
- Added a label to the "choose save slot" screen to differentiate between "new game" and "continue"
- Add interior trigger to taverns
